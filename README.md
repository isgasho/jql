# jql
Hey there!

You're probably here cause you're fed up with other json query processors being too complicated to use for anything surpassing simple single field selection.

Well, at least that's what led me here. And that's why I've written jql, a json query processor with an even more cryptic - lispy - syntax (Maybe not that cryptic after all? I quite like it :) )

Ok, let's check it out now, but first things first, you have to install it:
```
go get github.com/cube2222/jql
```

Ok. Done.

Let's check out a few _simple_ examples. (remember? That's explicitly *not* why we're here. But it aids understanding of the more complex examples, so stay with me just a little bit longer!)
```
```

Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's up with the parentheses?!

Remember what I said before? Lispy syntax. In short, whenever you see (add 1 2), it's basically the same as add(1, 2). I like that syntax for big hierarchical expressions, if you really really _really_ don't like it, then you can probably stop right here, though you'll be losing out! I've warned you.
